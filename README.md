# Hello-World

Hey! 

I have experience in sorting through Linguistic data and have a background in computer science. I have experience in Python, Voice recognition software, and analysis of linguistic data. I am continuing to build my coding experience with a data science Bootcamp. 

While in college, I wrote 10+ papers using voice recognition software (Praat) to interpret data and create phonetic analyses between multiple languages. The final paper of my senior year was a phonetic analysis of Persian Farsi vowels in which I demonstrated recording data, transcribing phonetic features, and reporting on the alterations between languages. I have written 50+ papers about Semantics, Syntax, Phonetics, Phonology, and Language Translation.
